# ImpactNet 🚀

 > **One-Sentence Pitch:** "ImpactNet fuses decades of market data (1990–2025) with learned information signals to decide when news and price action truly matter.”

## 💡 Inspiration
Modern quantitative trading is dominated by opaque systems trained on decades of market data, with little emphasis on reproducibility or understanding. As strong believers in open-source research, we built this project to show that long-horizon market models and information-driven signals can be developed transparently and shared for learning, experimentation, and verification.

## 🤖 What it does
ImpactNet turns market data and news into a clear trading signal.
1. Models trained on market data from 1990–2025 learn how prices behave across different regimes.
2. A lightweight language model analyzes new information and estimates whether it actually matters.
3. Both are combined into one simple score that helps decide when to trade, when to wait, and when to reduce risk.

## 🧠 Challenges we ran into
1. Turning messy information into something usable
2. Avoiding hidden data leakage
3. Balancing model power with practicality

## 🏅 Accomplishments that we're proud of
1. Proved advanced ideas can be open-source: Rather than treating sophisticated models as black boxes, we built everything with reproducibility and openness as first-class goals.
